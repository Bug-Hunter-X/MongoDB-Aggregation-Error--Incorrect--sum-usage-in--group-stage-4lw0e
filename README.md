# MongoDB Aggregation Error: Incorrect $sum usage in $group stage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$sum` operator within the `$group` stage. The error occurs when attempting to sum a field that does not contain numeric values.  The provided solution explains how to correct the pipeline and ensure accurate aggregation results.

## Bug Description
The provided script contains an incorrect MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The `$sum` operator in the `$group` stage is used to sum values of a field that may not always be numeric, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. The aggregation query is designed to group documents based on `fieldName` and sum the corresponding values in the `anotherField`. However, if `anotherField` contains non-numeric values, the pipeline throws an error or produces incorrect results.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the field being summed (`anotherField`) contains only numeric data. This can be accomplished through data validation and cleaning before running the aggregation pipeline.
